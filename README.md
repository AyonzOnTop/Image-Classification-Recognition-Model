# Image Classifier/ Recognition Project

## Introduction
This aim of this project is build a deep learning model using a pretrained neural network. The model would be use to categorize species of flowers commonly occuring in the United Kingdom.

## Data
Data was source from the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html), University of Oxford.

## Model
A PyTorch pretrained neural network ``vgg13`` was trained be the classifier

## Output 
The model was deployed to a command-line application that can classify the flower species into their categories.
